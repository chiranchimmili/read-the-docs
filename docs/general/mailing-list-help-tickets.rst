Help and Mailing List FAQs 
--------------------------

- Submit a help ticket using our dedicated webform at `https://crnch-rg.cc.gatech.edu/crnch-rg-help/ <https://crnch-rg.cc.gatech.edu/crnch-rg-help/>`__.
    -  `Help Request Webform Examples <https://gt-crnch-rg.readthedocs.io/en/main/general/rg-help-webform-examples.html>`__


-  The main CRNCH help ticket email address is crnch-rg-help@cc.gatech.edu. 
    - We would prefer if you use the webform but the email address is ok if you include your GT username (e.g., gburdell3 for George Burdell).

-  `Ask questions on the MS Teams group (GT users) <https://teams.microsoft.com/l/team/19%3acbae4953c30a44caad4afd4ef00e64be%40thread.tacv2/conversations?groupId=dfbaab66-ec98-4d00-9e91-ce166bc95432&tenantId=482198bb-ae7b-4b25-8b7a-6d7f32faa083>`__.  If you are external to GT, please use the Slack workspace.

-  Ask questions on CRNCH RG Slack `here <https://join.slack.com/t/gt-crnch-rg/shared_invite/zt-velklwgm-Bfh~IXesIM2uhrLs~y8s_w>`__. Note that since we are on a free plan that old conversations are not saved.

Help for the CRNCH Rogues Gallery
---------------------------------

The Rogues Gallery testbed is rapidly growing along with its support structures. In general, we try to respond to help tickets within 1 business day of your request. Note that the admins and researchers for this project work 9-6 ET Monday-Friday, so any requests outside of this timeframe will be delayed at least until the next business day. Tickets
submitted over the weekend or on any GT holidays will be evaluated on the following business day. Please note that Georgia Tech is officially closed for the last week of each calendar year for the Christmas holiday.

How do I request help?
----------------------

The Rogues Gallery uses a Request Tracker (RT) based ticketing system. You can submit tickets ideally via the `webform <https://crnch-rg.cc.gatech.edu/crnch-rg-help/>`__ or alternatively using the email address, crnch-rg-help@cc.gatech.edu. We would request that you submit a help ticket for anything that is not a discussion or
minor clarification question. This helps us track specific issues for users and also is important as a metric for our funded testbed project.

That said, the general process for asking for help is:

1. Check through the appropriate documentation on the public
   documentation or the internal wiki to see if this answers your
   question.

2. Ask a clarification question in the related MS Teams group. For
   example, if you are working with Alveo boards you may want to post
   your question in the ``fpga-xilinx`` channel on Teams.

3. During discussion on the Teams or email group we may move your
   question to the ticketing system or a private conversation if it is
   specific to your account. When possible, we'd like to keep most
   discussion in the appropriate channel as it provides a good reference
   for other users who may have the same issue.

   -  Submit tickets to the crnch-rg-help@cc.gatech.edu email address or
      ideally via the webform at https://crnch.gatech.edu/crnch-rg-help

4. As you get to more in-depth research, you may need to pose your
   question to an external vendor since most architectures in RG are
   very new and GT researchers and staff are constantly learning along
   with you. More information on specific vendor forums can be found
   from this `link <vendor-forums>`__.

How do I ask a good question?
-----------------------------

This is not meant to be a put down! Asking your question in a clear and
meaningful way is the easiest way to get assistance. We generally
recommend the following for asking a clear suggestion:

1. Share the machine name you are having issues with: Ex: "Python
   notebooks don't run on rg-neuro-dev.crnch.gatech.edu"

2. If possible, share the output using quotes or an attached log file.
   **Please share output as text where possible instead of a
   screenshot!**. If we are trying to recreate a problem you have it is
   much easier to copy and paste text than decipher it from a
   screenshot.

3. Create a "minimum working/reproducible example" (MWE/MRE). In many
   cases, sharing a huge log file for a full application is not useful
   to you or to the maintainers of a particular system. See this page on
   creating an effective MWE: `MWE
   overview <https://github.com/gt-crnch-rg/fc-with-rg-vip/blob/gh-pages/docs/development/%5BDevelopment%5D-Minimal-Reproducible-Examples.md>`__

4. Don't just state "Feature X doesn't work!". We'll ask you more
   follow-up questions so it's best to share more detail initially to
   get your question answered in a prompt fashion.

Specific Issues with Open OnDemand
----------------------------------
If you are having issues with using the Open OnDemand interface or VNC usage, please share the following additional information.

1. What app are you using? Ex: "VNC CRNCH Desktop"

2. What is the Session ID? This will usually be something like `f9d4be0d-xxxx-xxxxx-xxxx` that is shown on each card.

3. Is there any output from the `output.log`? You can access this from the session output by clicking on the Session ID. 

Mailing lists
-------------

GT is currently reevaluating how it implements mailing lists. Please use Slack or Teams instead to ask your questions. 

Vendor Forums
-------------
If we can't answer your question via chat, we may direct you to the relevant vendor forum for more assistance. See a list of related vendors `here <https://gt-crnch-rg.readthedocs.io/en/main/general/vendor-forums.html>`__.

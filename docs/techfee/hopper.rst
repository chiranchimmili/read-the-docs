Hopper - Grace Hopper Nodes
==========================

CRNCH RG has four Grace Hopper nodes, `hopper<1-4>`. Note that they live under the .cc.gatech.edu subnet but are accessible via Slurm.

Acknowledgments
===============

The Hopper systems are funded via GT's Techfee program, so usage for these servers are prioritized for coursework (when requested by instructors or students). Please read more about Techfee hardware `on this page <https://crnch-rg.cc.gatech.edu/tech-fee-hosted-equipment/>`__. This cluster was funded in FY2024 through the efforts of Will Powell.

How do I get to Hopper?
=======================

As with most CRNCH resources, you need to either log in via the gateway node, rg-login, or access the system from the campus network via VPN or an on-campus connection. 

To request an allocation on dash using slurm:

.. code::

    //Request an allocation of 1 hr, partition rg-nextgen-hpc, and specify the node name for the server with -w
    salloc -t 1:00:00 -p rg-nextgen-hpc -G H200:1

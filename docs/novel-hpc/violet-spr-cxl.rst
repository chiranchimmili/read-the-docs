Violet - Sapphire Rapids
========================

What's Interesting About This Hardware?
=======================================
The Violet servers use Intel Sapphire Rapids along with PCI Express 5.0 to support high-bandwidth accelerators as well as the new Compute Xpress Link (CXL) technology. Violet1 also hosts CRNCH's H100 PCIe GPU in partnership with `Dr. Bryngelson's lab <https://comp-physics.group/>`__.

Instinct is a single node server with two AMD 210 GPUs, which are very similar to the
MI250x GPUs deployed in `ORNL's Frontier <https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/frontier/>`__. This
server has two Milan CPUs, 512 GB of DDR4 memory, and a Connect-X 6 networking card.

How do I get to Violet?
=======================

As with most CRNCH resources, you need to either log in via the gateway
node, rg-login, or access the system from the campus network via VPN or
an on-campus connection. 

To request an allocation on Violet using slurm:

.. code::

    //Request an allocation of 1 hr, partition rg-nextgen-hpc, and specify the node name for the server with -w
    salloc -t 1:00:00 -p rg-nextgen-hpc -w violet1
   
To request an entire node (and all the memory) you can run:


.. code::

    //Request an allocation of with 2 sockets, all cores in each socket, and 2 threads per core, partition rg-nextgen-hpc, 
    //specify the node name for the server with -w, and request unlimited memory (otherwise cgroups limits to 1 GB per core)
    salloc --sockets-per-node=2 --cores-per-socket=64 --threads-per-core=2 -p rg-nextgen-hpc -w violet1 --mem=0
